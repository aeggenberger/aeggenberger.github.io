This time
is different (I think) because I have a reason other than self-expression for doing it.
I'm in charge of a Drupal 7 installation for a weekly newspaper. As I've added functionality 
and modules, I've learned a lot. Then I forgot it. Then I realized I didn't even know where
I learned it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is intended to be a public notebook for recording and sharing what I learn about 
the Drupal platform and running a small website.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="reasons"></category></entry></feed>
